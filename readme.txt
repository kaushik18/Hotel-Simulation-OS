Instructions on How to compile and run the program - ProjectTwo

Compilation:
	1) On command line, go to the directory where ProjectTwo.java is downloaded to.

	2) Once you are in the directory, type the following command to compile the program:	javac ProjectTwo.java

	3) This will create four class files: ProjectTwo.class, FrontDeskEmployee.class, Bellhop.class, and Guest.class


Running:

	1) After you see the above class files, to run the program, type the following command: 	java ProjectTwo


This will run the program. I only have one .java file and it has different classes in it. Also the hotel simulation will run through until all 24 guests are joined, and the output is similar to the one from the instructions(different depending on random allocation of luggage) but similar wording.
