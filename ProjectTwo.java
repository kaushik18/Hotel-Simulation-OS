// Project Two - Exploring Multiple Threads

// Project Description: A hotel is simulated by using threads to model customer and employee behavior.  

/* Project Overview: 
The hotel to be simulated has two employees at the front desk to register guests and two bellhops to handle guestsâ€™ bags.  
A guest will first visit the front desk to get a room number.  The front desk employee will find an available room and assign it to the guest.  
If the guest has less than 3 bags, the guest proceeds directly to the room.  Otherwise, the guest visits the bellhop to drop off the bags.  
The guest will later meet the bellhop in the room to get the bags, at which time a tip is given. */
